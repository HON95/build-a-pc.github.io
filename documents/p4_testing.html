            <p>We created a Google Form which asks the tester to navigate through the page and test the different features.
            The form had the following questions:</p>

            </header>

            <p>This is the summary of feedback we got from 13 testers. Our response is written below each question.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>How old are you?
                <ul>
                  <li>16-20: 67%</li>
                  <li>21-30: 33%</li>
                  <li>Others: 0%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: The people we contacted were in this range, which we thought was appropriate for people wanting to build a PC.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Are you currently using a mobile device to view the website?
                <ul>
                  <li>No: 77%</li>
                  <li>Yes: 23%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: We needed a few people to test the mobile version but most people testing the desktop version,
                  so this distribution is perfect for testing. We did not interfere with their choices.</p>
              </li>
              <li>What is the purpose of this website?
                <ul>
                  <li>Learning to build PCs: 69%</li>
                  <li>Don't know: 15%</li>
                  <li>Junk: 15%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: Most people understood the meaning of the site. The ones who didn't understand the purpose didn't specify why (maybe they didn't care).
                  We can't think of any way to make the purpose more clear, the site banner clearly says "Build-a-PC" and the home page says "A PC Building Tutorial".
                  If they didn't understand, they must not know what a PC is and therefore have no interest of building one either.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Do you think you will find the contents of this site interesting?
                <ul>
                  <li>Yes: 39%</li>
                  <li>No: 31%</li>
                  <li>Maybe: 31%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: The content of the site was a secondary priority, our primary priority was the layout, style, functionality, responsitivity, accessibility, and so on.
                  This could have been improved if we had a real client (not us) which provided us with the content.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Go to the page about the operating system Windows. How did you find this page?
                <ul>
                  <li>Via the dropdown menu at he top: 77%</li>
                  <li>Didn't find it: 15%</li>
                  <li>Other: (junk):  8%</li>
                  <li>Searching at the bottom: 0%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: Most people found it via the navigation bar, as expected.
                  The two people who didn't find it must not have tried very hard or must not be very experienced with normal web pages.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Try one of the quizzes. Would you bother answering this if we didn't ask you to?
                <ul>
                  <li>No: 69%</li>
                  <li>Yes: 31%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: We didn't ask if it worked, because it's such simple feature assumed to work. Some people would try it if not asked, which is nice.
                  We do not want to force people through the quizzes, if they want they can skip right past it, whatever they please.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Try using the search feature in the site footer. Did it work as expected?
                <ul>
                  <li>Yes: 69%</li>
                  <li>Don't know: 15%</li>
                  <li>No: 8%</li>
                  <li>Junk: 8%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: Most people claim it worked as expected. Two claimed they don't know, meaning they didn't bother to try (we can't do much about that).
                  One person claimed it did not, but did not specify why. Maybe that is the same person that wrote a comment about it in one of the latter questions.
                  Maybe we should ask more specifically about what didn't work in the form.</p>
              </li>
              <li>What did you find weird or wrong about the website?
                <ul>
                  <li>Nothing: 31%</li>
                  <li>Search bar at the bottom: 15%</li>
                  <li>Site not finished: 15%</li>
                  <li>Grammatical errors: 8%</li>
                  <li>Mainly designed for mobile devices: 8%</li>
                  <li>Junk: 23%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: Two people said that the search bar should be in the top.
                  We agree with that, but we decided to place it in the bottom because we already had an empty slot there, and it would be hard to place it in
                  the top because we would have to move it around a lot when the screen got smaller. It would be doable, but would require a lot of time
                  and effort getting it right, so we decided it was not worth it.</p>
                <p>Two people said that the site was not finished, which is correct. One of us did not meet the deadlines we agreed upon. See document P3 for more information.
                  One person said the site had a lot of grammatical errors. These are easy to fix, but we do not have enough time to fix all of them since
                  we are behind on schedule since the deadlines were not met. Lastly, one person said the site was designed mainly for mobile devices.</p>
              </li>
              <li>How could we improve the site (layout, features, etc.)?
                <ul>
                  <li>Don't know / nothing needs improvement: 64%</li>
                  <li>More pictures or better images: 23%</li>
                  <li>Buttons should look like buttons: 8%</li>
                  <li>Go to site once search is entered: 8%</li>
                  <li>Junk: 8%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: We notice how some pages could need some more images.
                  Since we are exceptional photographers, we would not be able to take much better images. We can not find any "bad" images.</p>

                <p>We're not sure which buttons need to look more like buttons, as we don't have many buttons on the site. Maybe the home page buttons
                  which link to the sections, which look very flat when not hovered (which touch users can't do). We could add some more shadow, maybe.</p>

                <p>The search related feedback might mean the user wants to go to a search page once he presses enter. We chose not to do this because the search function
                  is very basic and would not need a dedicated search page.</p>
              </li>
              <li>How well did you understand how the website works overall and how to navigate it?
                <ul>
                  <li>1 (Not at all): 8%</li>
                  <li>2: 0%</li>
                  <li>3: 15%</li>
                  <li>4: 15%</li>
                  <li>5 (Very well): 62%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Response: Most users understood wery well how to navigate the site and thought it worked well.
                  The others might have expressed their dissatisfaction in the previous question.</p>

            </header>

            <h2 if="self_reflection_haavard"><a href="#self_reflection_haavard">H&aring;vard</a></h2>
            <p>I knew a bit of HTML and CSS before the course started, so I didn't attend many lectures.
              I have however learned a lot of JS and have gotten much more fluent in HTML and CSS.
              I have always wanted to get more experience with web development, but have not had the motivation to do so,
              so I'm glad I attended this course which pushed me forward and forced me to learn the essentials.</p>
            <p>I have gotten much more experienced working in groups for projects on this size,
              distributing the development of different parts but cooperating on the grand design and function,
              meeting with the team members and planning forward, and trying to meet deadlines.</p>

            <h2 if="self_reflection_petter"><a href="#self_reflection_petter">Petter</a></h2>
            <p>This project have learned me a good amount about teamwork. How important the groups dynamic is for the work.</p>
            <p>In our group 3 of us was on Facebooks messenger, and 3 of us was on mail.
              So we had to use both for sending messages something I think killed some of the dynamic to the group.</p>
            <p>Deadlines has become more important, not only beacuse of the deadlines set by project makers,
              but also for our own sake, with deadlines we have a goal to work after.</p>

            <h2 if="self_reflection_runar"><a href="#self_reflection_runar">Runar</a></h2>
            <p>Når jeg tenkter tilbake på denne perioden vi har jobbet med prosjektet mener jeg at vi kunne ha jobbet mye mer effektivt og regelmessig.
              Min oppfatning er at ting har blitt like før deadlines og jeg tror at hvis vi skulle ha gjort dette på nytt at
              vi burde hatt strammere tidsfrister. Utenom dette er jeg fornøyd med resultatet som vi til slutt endte opp med.</p>
