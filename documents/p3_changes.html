            </header>
			<p>Everyone fulfilled their minimum requirements. Created 1 JavaScript each, and made the content for their assigned section.</p>
			<p>Håvard must be given a medal for his work on the visuals of the page, where he created everything you see on the page from background, banner, footer, fonts. He basically created a template for us other to use. And his amazing work with implementing AJAX and the navigation bar. His AJAX code means that we can load only the parts of the webpage that changs not the entire page, this means all layout is in index.html the content loads from the respecting html files. Runar must be given the credits for the creation of the logo.</p>
			<p>We are using external CSS files for styling, the same with JavaScript. They can be found in style/ and script/ folders in the project. When we are using external files like this we dont have to create a file for every page we create.</p>
			<p>The Javascript files is going to be compined into 1 file, without unnecessary whitespace.</p>
