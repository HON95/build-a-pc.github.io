            <ul>
              <li>[2016.10.28] Changed logo.</li>
              <li>[2016.10.31] The highlighting feature was dropped, because its use was limited and it required very little JavaScript coding.
              Runar, which was assigned to this task, will instead implement the quiz validation feature which originally was assigned to Petter.</li>
              <li>[2016.11.02] The "beginner/expert mode" feature was dropped, because no potential uses were clear. This task was assigned to Thomas.
              As of now, each member has one feature to work on or previously worked on.</li>
              <li>[2016.11.02] Petter is not entirely finished with the search feature, and has been granted another week to finish it.
              Thomas is not finished with the dynamic breadcrumbs feature, and has also been granted another week to finish it.</li>
              <li>[2016.11.02] Since the distribution of content writing was not mentioned in the product specification, it will be specified here.
              Petter will write the "Parts" section. Runar will write the "Part Vendors" section, and possibly help with the "Windows" page in the "Operating Systems" section.
              Thomas will write most of the "Operating Systems" section. H&aring;vard will write the "Assembling the PC" section.
              The deadline for this is early November 13th.</li>
