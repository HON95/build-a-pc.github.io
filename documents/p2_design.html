            <header>
              <h1><a href="#content">Content</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need to give
            a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the mockup of the page.
            The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it
            contribute into fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is that
            you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in your mockup of the
            page you will be using fake text, fake images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should
            try to use meaningful headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally you should
            describe the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Every page of the website will have the same top with logo, dropdown,breadcrumps, and the sides, bottom will also be the same</p>
            <p>The middlepart will be build up of a Title(Part, Part Vendors..) and a Subtitle(Motherboard, RAM...), down the site we will have inforamtion about what the Subtitle refers to, together with pictures and videos if time,</p>
            <p>This describes the Subpages, the mainpage will be different. The mainpage will have information about the page it self, guides how to use it (the use of the dropdown menu), what the goal of the webpage is, any function we have implemented (highlightning of link elements, search function), and last some information about ourself</p>

            <p>1. AJAX, for updating the page without reloading the whole page</p>
            <p>2. Some sort of testvalidation after each part, to see if the reader has learned anything, and of they have to read something again.</p>
            <p>3. Highlightning elements that is linked to eachother, like text of exemple1 and the pictre of exemple2, where if you hover over 1 you will highlight the other</p>
            <p>4. Set beginner mode or expert mode, change the content of the page depending of mode. Showing more indeept content for expert and hiding it for beginner</p>
            <p>5. Search on webpage with auto complete</p>
            <p>6. Dynamic breadcrumps</p>
            <p>Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements. ??</p>

            </header>

            <p>Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks
      to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
      list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
      complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
      when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
      the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.</p>

      <p>The most important things we have to build is the dropdown menu, breadcrumps, search function and AJAX this functions is what the user will experience the most and will give the best experience of the webpage</p>
      <p>We most not forget that the actual text content have to be written, this will take a lot of time to compile together</p>
      <p>List of placement of files and folders</p>
      <p>main level: file: index.html, folders: documents, favicon, images, style, javascript.
      <p>Documents: Any documents required for the project</p>

Where the folder "logo" contains the logos for our website, "parts" contains pictures of the parts we include on our webpage, "website" contains every other element we use on our webpage, main level on this folder will also include elements the webpage is made of</p>
      <p>Style: will contain any css stylesheets we create</p>
      <p>JavaScript: will contain any javascrips we create</p>
      <p>Petter and Thomas have to get the pictures of the parts before we start the coding, Petter will get all the pictures of parts required to build a pc before 14.10 if the mail dont screw up. Thomas will help with the taking of them</p>
      <p>Runar will get the logos, backgrounds and other elements required for the webpage finished by XX.XX WE NEED TIME</p>
      <p>Everyone will help with the JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and get it fini by XX.XX WE NEED TIME</p>
      <p>JavaScripts needed are AJAX, Highlightning, beginner/expert mode, search function, dynamic breadcrumps, testformvalidation</p>
