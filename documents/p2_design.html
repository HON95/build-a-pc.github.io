            <p>This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need to give
			a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the mockup of the page.
			The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it
			contribute into fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is that
			you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in your mockup of the
			page you will be using fake text, fake images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should
			try to use meaningful headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally you should
			describe the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any). Here is an
			example:</p>

          <section id="tmp_sect_5">
            <header>
              <h1><a href="#tmp_sect_5">Our plan about how to finish</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks
			to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
			list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
			complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
			when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
			the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.</p>
