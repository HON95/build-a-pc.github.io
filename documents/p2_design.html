            <p>JavaScript.</p>
			<p>1. AJAX, for updating the page without reloading the whole page</p>
			<p>2. Some sort of testvalidation after each part, to see if the reader has learned anything, and of they have to read something again.</p>
			<p>3. Highlightning elements that is linked to eachother, like text of exemple1 and the pictre of exemple2, where if you hover over 1 you will highlight the other</p>
			<p>4. Set beginner mode or expert mode, change the content of the page depending of mode. Showing more indeept content for expert and hiding it for beginner</p>
			<p>5. Search on webpage with auto complete</p>
			<p>6. Dynamic breadcrumps</p>
			<p>Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements. ??</p>

              <h1><a href="#tmp_sect_2">Navigation Structure</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>Navigation Structure:</p>
			<p>Every subpage of the website will have the dropdown menu and the breadcrumps. Getting around the page will be very easy. Where you can get back with the breadcrumps, and jump cross sections with the dropdown menu. Becasue of this every page will link to each other.</p>
			<p>We will also describe how to navigate the webpage on the frontpage, in a how to use tutorial of the webpage. </p>
			<p>A search function will be included for when a vistor cant find what he want to see, where he will get results linking what the search function can find on the website</p>

              <h1><a href="#tmp_sect_3">Page Layout and Appearance</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>(types and sizes??), the color scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.??)</p>
			<p>The positions of elements on the webpage can you see in the mockup of the webpage. We have a dropdown menu and breadcrumps on the top of the webpage for easy accses and visibility all the time. The footer at the bottom with external links.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="tmp_sect_4">
            <header>
              <h1><a href="#tmp_sect_4">Content</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need to give
			a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the mockup of the page.
			The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it
			contribute into fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is that
			you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in your mockup of the
			page you will be using fake text, fake images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should
			try to use meaningful headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally you should
			describe the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Every page of the website will have the same top with logo, dropdown,breadcrumps, and the sides, bottom will also be the same</p>
			<p>The middlepart will be build up of a Title(Part, Part Vendors..) and a Subtitle(Motherboard, RAM...), down the site we will have inforamtion about what the Subtitle refers to, together with pictures and videos if time,</p>
			<p>This describes the Subpages, the mainpage will be different. The mainpage will have information about the page it self, guides how to use it (the use of the dropdown menu), what the goal of the webpage is, any function we have implemented (highlightning of link elements, search function), and last some information about ourself</p>

			to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
			list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
			complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
			when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
			the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.</p>
