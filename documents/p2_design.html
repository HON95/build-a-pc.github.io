            </header>

            <p>We are Ad Infinitum, and we are creating a website to teach people about building personal computers, and how its parts work, which part vendors to pick from and which operatins systems to choose from.
            That is our goal and purpose. The desired audience is people curious about this, but not knowing how to do it.</p>

            <header>
              <h1><a href="#nav_struct">Navigation Structure</a></h1>
            </header>

            <p>Every page will have the same navigation bar with dropdown menus which links to all the normal pages of the website, so that all the normal pages link to each other.
              By normal, I mean pages intended for the user to visit.
              Other, less relevant pages, like these documents, will be linked in the footer of every normal page.
              The site map will also be linked to in the footer, and will act like a normal page once entered (normal except not linked to in navigation bar).
              All normal pages except home will also use breadcrumbs, right under the navigation bar, which links to all parent pages.
              The home page will contain some basic information of what the site consists of and how to reach it.
              We will also implement a front-end search feature, located in the site header as a text field, where the user can find all pages and some page sections on the site.</p>

            <h2 id="logical_struct"><a href="#logical_struct">Logical Navigation Structure</a></h2>
            <p>This is how the user will experience the navigation structure.
              The structure consists of a hierarchical structure of sections and pages. Sections are logical groupings of pages, and will each have a section page with links to all pages in that section.</p>
            <p>All pages will use index.html, which will load the content of pages via AJAX. The pages will be accessable via the query string of a URL,
              so that instead of links like "example.com/page5", we will have links like "example.com?p=page5".
              The reason we chose this method to reduce overhead (boilerplate) between pages, since we can't use server processing.
              When a user goes to another in-site page, only the content part will be reloaded, and info like window title, URL, etc will be updated programmatically.</p>

            <ul>

            </header>

            <p>All pages of the website will be based on one generic layout. This layout consists of a full-width header, full-width footer, and a central part.
              The header will consist of the site logo, site name, client/author name, a search field and possibly some social icons (probably not).
              The central part will have limited width and will consist of a navigation bar with dropdown menus, breadcrumbs (except home), and the content (the dynamic "page").
              The footer will consist of two columns, the first with a site description, the second with misc. links, and a copyright line beneath the columns.</p>

            <p>The home page will contain information about the site it self. The structure of the website, what the goal of the website is, how the website will obtain this goal, the different functions you can use on the site (quizes after subpages, search function), and at the end inforamtion about the creators of the page, ourself.</p>
	    <p>The subpages will contain inforamtion about PC parts, different PC parts makers, Operating Systems, how to build a PC. where everyone have their subpages again that goes more indept. At the end of the subpages we will have a short quiz that ask questions about what the readers have read and checks if the reader have learned something or if he has the reread it. Complementing the informaion we will have pictures that will help, we will link the text and coresponding pictures with highlightning</p>
            <p>Every page of the website will have the same top with logo and the dropdown, the sides will be the same, bottom will also be the same, the subpages also will have breadcrumps</p>

	    <p>For fullfing the requirements for the project we have found 6 uses of JavaScript we will implement. The list and a short description of the function can use see underneath.</p>
	    <ol>
                <li>AJAX, for updating the page without reloading the whole page.</li>
                <li>Validation of quiz at the end of the subpages, to see if the reader has learned anything, and of they have to reread something again.</li>
                <li>Highlightning elements that is linked to eachother, like text of exemple1 and the pictre of exemple1, where if you hover over 1 you will highlight the other.</li>
                <li>Set beginner mode or expert mode, change the content of the page depending of mode. Showing more indeept content for expert and hiding it for beginner.</li>
                <li>Front end search on webpage with auto complete, showing results from the webpage.</li>
                <li>Dynamic breadcrumps.</li>
            </ol>
	    <p>All of us have been given 1-2 of this JavaScripts to make.</p>
	    <p>AJAX we must set what we will have as static elements on the page, and what parts we will have dynamic.</p>
	    <p>The validation of the quizes will be solved with having a form with the answers and check that up agains what the vistors have answered, updating the site with Javascript with the results, no popups.</p>
	    <p>Highlightning require we give correct classes for elements, and when you hover over one Javascript will go over the page find more and update the site seamlessly with the new elements highlighted</p>
	    <p>For Beginner/Expert mode we have to create differnet/more content that will be changed/added depending of a settning we will have on the page</p>
	    <p>Search function must go throug every subpage and match its content with the search term and give the vistor a link to the subpage and placment on the page for the found term.</p>
	    <p>Breadcrumps will update depending on subpages name, and remove add as the vistor moves.</p>

      <p>The most important things we have to build is the dropdown menu, breadcrumps, search function and AJAX this functions is what the user will experience the most and will give the best experience of the webpage</p>
      <p>We most not forget that the actual text content have to be written, this will take a lot of time to compile together</p>
      <p>Petter and Thomas have to get the pictures of the parts before we start the coding, Petter will get all the pictures of parts required to build a pc before 14.10 if the mail dont screw up. Thomas will help with the taking of them</p>
      <p>Runar will get the logos, backgrounds and other elements required for the webpage finished by 01.11</p>
      <p>Everyone will help with the JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and get it finished by 01.11</p>
      <p>JavaScripts needed are AJAX, Highlightning, beginner/expert mode, search function, dynamic breadcrumps, testformvalidation</p>
      <p>Håvard need to finish AJAX by 01.11</p>
      <p>Petter need to finish search function by 01.11</p>
      <p>Runar need to finish Highlightning by 01.11</p>
      <p>Thomas need to finish dynamic breadcrumps by 01.11</p>
      <p>Petter need to finish the validation of quiz by 01.11</p>
      <p>Thomas need to finish beginner/expert mode by 01.11</p>
      <p>We have set every deadline to 01.11 because then we will have 12 days before the project should be finished for adjusments and eventual changes to be made. When we have set every deadline to 01.11 will also have a choose about what we will begin with, instead of work with what has the earliest deadline. We will off course have meetings in the meantime where we will see how far we have gotten</p>
      <p>For list of files and folders see "File Navigation Structure" section.</p>
	  <p>List of files needed to be created</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>JavaScripts, 6 of them for each function when developing, 1 file when we are finished</li>
		<li>Content files, text files containing all of the information about the parts, vendors, operating systems, and how to build the pc</li>
		<li>HTML files for every subpage need to be created</li>
