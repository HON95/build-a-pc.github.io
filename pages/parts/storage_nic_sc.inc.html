      <p>In 2016 we have 2 technologies for storage HDD and SSD. Hard Disk Drive and Solid State Drive.</p>
	  <p>HDD is the most used, cheapest and have a lot of space, SDD is beginning to take over for HDD, but is a bit pricier at the moment, you can have a lot of space but you have to pay.</p>
	  <p>HDD comes commonly in to forms, 2,5" and 3,5" this is the size of the spinning disk inside, the outer dimensions is bigger but they are also standardized. 2,5" is used in laptops and small PCs and are a bit pricier than 3,5". 3,5" is used in desktop. What determents the speed of HDDs is the RPM on the spinning disk inside and number of plates. Normal RPM is 5400rpm and 7200rpm and normal storage space range from 100GB to 4000GB/4TB.</p>
	  <p>SSD have many forms, the normal 2,5" size that is exact the same size as 2,5" a HDD. But also we have M.2, U.2, and PCI forms. Speed of SSD can vary a bit, but one thing can we say for sure, it is much faster than a normal HDD. Speed of a normal consumer 2,5" SSD lays around 500MB/s read and write, but can reach up to 3000MB/s read and 1500MB/s write for the other SSDs marketed for the more extreme user that is willing to pay up.</p>

      </header>

      <p>A cabled network card is usually integrated into your motherboard and has the speed 1Gb/s this is more than enough performance for a normal user. But if you want Wi-Fi on your PC you may very often buy an external card or if you want the best of the best cabled internet.</p>
	  <p>For external Wi-Fi card it is important if it support the newest Wi-Fi standard AC, or AC Wave 2 and the speed you can get from around 300Mb/s up to 1500Mb/s. You have to decide how much money you are going to use on a network card, but remember your Wi-Fi-router must support the speeds and the standards.</p>
	  <p>External cabled card must now a day’s support speeds up to 1Gb/s. Buying an external cabled card isn’t something a normal user would because the integrated to the motherboard is more than enough, but if you want an extra for more bandwidth or 2 networks you can get one.</p>
	  <p>Remember an external card will take up a PCI-E x1 or x4 slot, you have to have the connector on the motherboard and the space.</p>

      </header>

      <p>This is very similar to an external network card. You have already a sound card integrated on your motherboard. A normal user wouldn't need an external card. If you are a Hi-Fi enthusiast you want to buy one, the pricier the better.</p>
