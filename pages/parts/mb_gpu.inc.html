      <p>The motherboard is what connects the parts of your PC, the name is a hint to this.</p>
	  <p>What motherboard you buy isn’t that important besides that it supports your CPU and other parts, to match the CPU your motherboard must be of the same platform / sockets as your CPU. Pricier motherboard will do little for the overall performance of your PC, but it can add extra features as more connectors for HDDs, M.2 support and more USB connectors.</p>
	  <p>Motherboard comes in many form factors as ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ATX, Nano-ATX where ATX is the most normal and popular. The difference between them is the size. This mean that you have to check if your case can fit and support the form factor you choose. Smaller motherboard will also don’t fit the same amount of connector / features as one bigger.</p>

      <p>Video Card or GPU or Graphics Processing Unit is what produce the picture on your screen. The GPU can be a part of your CPU or a standalone part of your PC.</p>
	  <p>A GPU is very similar with a CPU, the difference is that a CPU is made up of 1-8 cores, where a GPU is made up of around 1000. This is because than can the GPU split the image to many little parts and process them at the same.</p>
	  <p>When buying a GPU have to think over performance need, cooling and price.</p>
	  <p>Performance: Can you live with a built-in GPU? or are you going to play games, or do video editing. Then you need an external GPU, where the price usually decides the performance of the GPU. The big competitors on the GPU market is nVidia and AMD. As late 2016 nVidia has the best performing GPUs but at a high price, AMD as not yet released their top-tier GPUs.</p>
	  <p>Cooling: External GPUs need cooling, we have 3 types of cooling, blower-style, fan-style, water-cooling. The fan-style is the most used and used in normal PCs, then the blower-style it is used in normal PCs but it performance best in small cases where it is little air. Water-cooling is used when you will overclock or in a tight case.</p>
      <p>Price: The price is what decides what performance you will get, pricier gives more performance, but is it a linear scale? No. In low/mid cost GPUs maybe, but in the higher range you will gain less performance for per money you use.</p>
