      <h2 id="infto"><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>Most operating systems, including Windows and the most common Linux distrubutions have very easy different installation instructions, which changes once in a while.
        Therefore I will not write too specific instructions on this, but instead briefly guide you.</p>

      <h2 id="windows"><a href="#windows">Installing Windows</a></h2>
      <p>Windows costs a bit but most of the programs you might want to use supports it (like Microsoft Office and most games) (Linux often has a lot of open alternatives, though) and might be considered easier to use for some.
        If you're going for Windows 10, purchase it somewhere (you might find some cheap shops online) and download the media download program from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/software-download/windows10">here</a>.
        This program downloads Windows and helps you burn it to a disc drive or a USB flash drive. Then just boot your new PC from this drive.</p>

      <h2 id="linux"><a href="#linux">Installing Linux</a></h2>
      <p>The best bast of Linux is that it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open</a> and most distros are free (as in the price is $0). If you're new to Linux, I recomment <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> or <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.
        Both have very simple installation instructions, which include downloading some disk image and burning it to a DVD or USB flash drive.</p>

      <h2 id="macosx"><a href="#macosx">Installing Mac OS X</a></h2>
      <p>As long as this isn't a Macintosh computer, installing Mac OS X is illegal. Why did I include this subsection?</p>
