      <p>Windows is a operating system developed by Microsoft.
During the growing popularity of graphical user interfaces(GUI) in 1985, Microsoft and Windows found its place in the market. Since then,
Windows have continually been updated and new versions have been released every few years. Today, Microsoft Windows has grown to own more than 90% of the market share.</p>

        Windows 1.0 was the very first version and it was released in 1985, one year after Mac OS. Windows 1.0 featured components like calculator,
calender, clock, control panel, notepad, paint and some other features. In Windows 1.0, only the modal dialog boxes could overlap windows. When Windows 2.0
        came in 1987 there were many improvements, among these were keyboard shortcuts, user interface overhaul and overlapping windows.
