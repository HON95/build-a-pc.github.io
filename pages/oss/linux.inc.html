      <p>Linux, just like Windows, is a computer operating system. Linux was assembled under the 
model of free and open-source software development and distribution. Linux was released in 1991, 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>Linux was developed as a free operating system for personal computers, but has since its release been ported 
onto more platforms than any other operating system. Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux has the 
largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.</p>
      <p>Linux is also the leading operating system when it comes to servers and other systems like mainframe computers and 
supercomputers. Linux also runs on the embedded systems, which means it runs on devices whose operating system is built into 
the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. Despite of the popularity Linux has on all the platforms combined, 
it is only used on ca 2.3% of desktop computers.</p>
      <p>Development of the Linux operating system is one of the most pominent results of open-source software collaboration. 
The underlying source code for Linux may be used, modified and distributed by anyone. Because of this, there exists multiple 
versions of Linux. Some of the mist popular mainstream ones are Debian, Linux Mint, openSUSE, Mageia, Arch Linux etc.</p>
